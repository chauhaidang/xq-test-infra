## 🚀 NEW: Intelligent API Gateway Integration

### Architecture Enhancement
The system has been upgraded with an **intelligent API gateway** that provides unified service access with automatic routing based on HTTP methods and paths.

### Gateway Features Implemented
- ✅ **Method-Based Routing**: Automatic routing by HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- ✅ **Path Pattern Matching**: Support for exact paths and wildcard patterns (`/api/todos/*`)
- ✅ **CQRS Pattern Support**: Read operations route to read-service, write operations route to write-service
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Service-name routing (`/service-name/`) still functional
- ✅ **Single Entry Point**: E2E tests use one URL instead of multiple service URLs

### Gateway Routing Configuration
```yaml
# todo-read-service.service.yml
routes:
  - methods: [GET]
    paths: ["/api/todos/*", "/health"]

# todo-write-service.service.yml
routes:
  - methods: [POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH]
    paths: ["/api/todos/*"]
```

### Generated nginx Configuration
```nginx
location ~ ^\/api\/todos(\/|$) {
    if ($request_method = GET) {
        proxy_pass http://todo-read-service_upstream;
    }
    if ($request_method = POST) {
        proxy_pass http://todo-write-service_upstream;
    }
    if ($request_method = PUT) {
        proxy_pass http://todo-write-service_upstream;
    }
    if ($request_method = DELETE) {
        proxy_pass http://todo-write-service_upstream;
    }
    if ($request_method = PATCH) {
        proxy_pass http://todo-write-service_upstream;
    }
    ...
}
```

### Manual Testing Results
| Request | Method | Route | Result |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| `/health` | GET | → Read Service | ✅ PASS |
| `/api/todos` | GET | → Read Service | ✅ PASS |
| `/api/todos` | POST | → Write Service | ✅ PASS |
| `/api/todos/1` | PUT | → Write Service | ✅ PASS |
| `/api/todos/1` | DELETE | → Write Service | ✅ PASS |
| `/api/todos/bulk-status` | PATCH | → Write Service | ✅ PASS |

### E2E Test Integration
**Before Gateway:**
```javascript
const readClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.READ_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
})
const writeClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.WRITE_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:3002'
})
```

**After Gateway:**
```javascript
const gatewayURL = process.env.GATEWAY_URL || 'http://localhost:8080'
const readClient = axios.create({ baseURL: gatewayURL })
const writeClient = axios.create({ baseURL: gatewayURL })
```

### Benefits Achieved
1. **Simplified Test Configuration**: One URL instead of multiple service URLs
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Tests don't need to know about service topology
3. **CQRS Pattern Enforcement**: Gateway enforces read/write separation
4. **Production-Ready Architecture**: Industry-standard API gateway pattern
5. **Flexible Deployment**: Services can be scaled/moved without test changes

### xq-infra CLI Workflow Validated
```bash
# 1. Build Docker images
./build-all-services.sh --github-token $GITHUB_TOKEN

# 2. Generate compose from multi-file service configs
node ../bin/xq-infra.js generate -f services

# 3. Start services with intelligent gateway
node ../bin/xq-infra.js up

# 4. Run E2E tests through gateway
DB_PORT=5432 DB_NAME=todoapp npm test

# 5. Cleanup
node ../bin/xq-infra.js down
```

## 🔧 Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Read Service Parameter Validation Bug
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Problem**:
- Read service incorrectly used `query('id')` instead of `param('id')` for path parameter validation
- All GET `/api/todos/:id` requests failed with HTTP 400 errors
- Complete todo lifecycle tests were broken

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// Before (Broken)
getTodoById: [
    query('id').isInt({ min: 1 }).withMessage('id must be a positive integer')
]

// After (Fixed)
getTodoById: [
    param('id').isInt({ min: 1 }).withMessage('id must be a positive integer')
]
```

**Impact**:
- Fixed 2 failing tests in CRUD workflow
- Improved system reliability from 86.7% to 93.3%
- Restored complete CRUD functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/todo-services/read-service/src/controllers/todoController.js`

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Due Date Null Handling (Priority: Medium)
**Issue**: Write service rejects `due_date: null` updates
**Impact**: Prevents clearing due dates on existing todos
**Error**: HTTP 400 when attempting to set due_date to null
**Recommendation**: Update write service validation to allow null values for due_date field

#### 2. Test Infrastructure Enhancement (Priority: Low)
**Issue**: Some constraint validation tests generate expected error logs
**Impact**: Cluttered test output
**Recommendation**: Implement test-specific error handling or suppress expected validation errors
