# Feature Specification: Node.js CLI for Test Container Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-node-js-cli`
**Created**: September 14, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Node.js CLI app to manage containers defined by pre-existing YAML files (image and tag). CLI can start/stop all containers on demand, ensure containers connect in a test environment, provide a default API gateway to hook all containers for a single endpoint, allow pulling images from private registry, and override image version/tag."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   - Actors: Tester
   - Actions: Start/stop containers, connect containers, provide API gateway, pull images from private registry, override image version/tag
   - Data: Pre-defined YAML files (container specs: image, tag)
   - Constraints: All containers must be networked for interconnectivity; must support private registries and image overrides
3. The CLI supports starting all containers at once, but allows ignoring individual containers via argument (e.g., --ignore <container>)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (container spec, gateway config, registry credentials)
7. Run Review Checklist
   - Gateway must provide default endpoint for all containers: use a simple reverse proxy setup, route based on container names/ports
   - Containers must be networked: use Docker networks or similar to ensure interconnectivity
   - Registry credentials only passed at runtime
   - Stop app handler is expected for failed image pulls or container starts
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing
- As a tester, I can run a CLI command to start all containers defined in YAML specs, creating a test environment where all services are networked and reachable.
- As a tester, I can stop all containers on demand to clean up the environment.
- As a tester, I can override image versions/tags for any container before starting the environment.
- As a tester, I can pull images from a private registry using credentials provided at runtime.
- As a tester, I can access all services through a single API gateway endpoint, which proxies requests to the appropriate container.
- As a tester, I can ignore specific containers when starting the environment by passing an argument to the CLI (e.g., --ignore <container>).
- As a tester, I receive clear error messages and status reports if image pulls or container starts fail.

## Functional Requirements
1. The CLI must accept one or more YAML files describing containers (image, tag, ports, etc.).
2. The CLI must be able to start all containers on demand, ensuring they are networked for interconnectivity.
3. The CLI must be able to stop all containers on demand, cleaning up the test environment.
4. The CLI must allow overriding image versions/tags for any container before starting.
5. The CLI must support pulling images from private registries, accepting credentials at runtime (not persisted).
6. The CLI must provide a default API gateway endpoint that proxies requests to all running containers.
7. The CLI must report errors and status in a clear, testable way (e.g., exit codes, logs).
8. The CLI must allow ignoring specific containers when starting the environment (e.g., --ignore <container> argument).
9. The CLI must provide a stop handler for failed image pulls or container starts, ensuring the app exits gracefully and reports the error.

## Key Entities
- Container Spec (YAML): image, tag, ports, environment variables
- Registry Credentials: username/password or token (runtime only)
- API Gateway Config: endpoint, routing rules (if any)
- Test Environment: set of running containers, network

## Review Checklist
- All user needs are described and testable
- All requirements are functional, not technical
- All ambiguities are marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] if any
- No implementation details included
- Ready for planning phase
