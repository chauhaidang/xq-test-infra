# xq-infra Implementation Tasks

---

## Current Feature: GitHub Actions E2E Testing Workflow

### Overview
Implement comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow to automate E2E testing of todo-app using xq-infra CLI.

**Goal**: Automate the entire test lifecycle - build Docker images, deploy with xq-infra, run E2E tests, and cleanup.

**Current State**: Basic CI workflow exists (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that only tests the CLI tool (unit tests, linting)

**Target State**: Complete E2E workflow that validates both xq-infra CLI and todo-app example in real-world usage

---

## Task List

### Phase 1: Helper Scripts
Create supporting scripts needed by the workflow.

- [x] **Task 1**: Create wait-for-services health check script
  - Create `todo-app/e2e-tests/setup/wait-for-services.sh`
  - Implement timeout-based health check polling for gateway endpoint
  - Check gateway at `http://localhost:8080` (or configured port)
  - Verify services are accessible through gateway intelligent routing
  - Add clear console output for debugging
  - Make script executable (`chmod +x`)
  - Test script locally with xq-infra

**Files to create:**
- `todo-app/e2e-tests/setup/wait-for-services.sh`

**Note**: E2E tests and build scripts are already properly configured:
- Tests use single `GATEWAY_URL` (default: http://localhost:8080) via `utils/http-clients.js`
- Gateway handles intelligent routing to read/write services based on HTTP methods
- Database connection already uses environment variables with fallback defaults in `setup/db-connection.js`
- Build scripts already support CI with `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
- Dockerfiles use secure multi-stage builds

---

### Phase 2: E2E Workflow Implementation
Create the main GitHub Actions workflow file.

- [x] **Task 2**: Create E2E workflow file structure
  - Create `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`
  - Define workflow trigger conditions:

  - Install E2E test dependencies (`npm ci` in `todo-app/e2e-tests/`)
  - Run E2E test suite (`npm test`)
  - Generate test reports
  - Upload test results as artifacts

- [x] **Task 7**: Implement "Cleanup and Logging" job steps
  - Add step to capture logs on failure:
    - `./bin/xq-infra.js logs`
  - Upload logs as artifacts (on failure)
  - Add cleanup step (always runs):
    - `./bin/xq-infra.js down`

## Workflow Architecture

### Single Comprehensive Workflow (Chosen Approach)

```yaml
E2E Tests Workflow (.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml)
├── Job: e2e-tests
│   ├── Step 1: Checkout code
│   ├── Step 2: Setup Node.js
│   ├── Step 3: Install xq-infra CLI
│   ├── Step 4: Setup Docker Buildx
│   ├── Step 5: Build Docker images
│   ├── Step 6: Generate compose with xq-infra
│   ├── Step 7: Start services with xq-infra
│   ├── Step 8: Wait for services (health checks)
│   ├── Step 9: Run E2E tests
│   ├── Step 10: Capture logs (on failure)
│   └── Step 11: Cleanup (always)
```

### Environment Variables

```yaml
# E2E Test Configuration
GATEWAY_URL: http://localhost:8080  # Single entry point (default in http-clients.js)

# Database Configuration (for test setup/teardown)
DB_HOST: localhost
DB_PORT: 5432
DB_NAME: todoapp
DB_USER: todouser
DB_PASSWORD: todopass
```

**Note**: Tests use gateway intelligent routing - no need for separate service URLs.

### Expected Timeline

| Stage | Duration | Cacheable |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Setup & Install | 30-60s | Yes (npm) |
| Docker Build | 3-5min | Yes (layers) |
| Service Startup | 30-60s | No |
| E2E Tests | 2-3min | No |
| Cleanup | 10-30s | No |
| **Total** | **7-11min** | - |

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Single workflow file**: All E2E testing in one workflow for simplicity
2. **Multi-file config**: Use `todo-app/services/` directory (new approach)
3. **Auto port assignment**: Let xq-infra assign ports (3002, 3003)
4. **Health checks**: Wait script with timeout for service readiness
5. **Cleanup strategy**: Always run cleanup, even on failure
6. **Log capture**: Automatic log collection using `xq-infra logs` on failure
7. **GitHub token**: Use `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)

### Security Considerations
- GitHub tokens only used in build stage (multi-stage Docker builds)
- No secrets persisted in final Docker images
- Tokens automatically scoped by GitHub Actions
- Database credentials for test environment only (not production)

### Benefits
- ✅ Validates xq-infra CLI in real-world scenario
- ✅ Tests todo-app example application
- ✅ Automates entire test lifecycle
- ✅ Catches integration issues early
- ✅ Provides confidence for releases
- ✅ Documents workflow for contributors

### Implementation Notes

**Phase 2 - E2E Workflow Implementation (Completed 2025-10-11)**

Created comprehensive E2E workflow file `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` that includes:

1. **Workflow Triggers**:
   - Push to main branch
   - Pull requests to main branch
   - Path filters for relevant code changes (src/, todo-app/, bin/, workflow file)

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Single GATEWAY_URL entry point (http://localhost:8080)
   - Database configuration for test setup/teardown
   - All environment variables properly defined at workflow level

3. **Job Structure** (single comprehensive job with 20-minute timeout):
   - Setup: Checkout, Node.js 20, npm cache, xq-infra installation and verification
   - Build: Docker Buildx setup, image building with GITHUB_TOKEN, image verification
   - Deploy: Compose generation, service startup, health check waiting, container verification
   - Test: E2E test dependency installation, test execution with proper env vars, test result upload
   - Cleanup: Log capture on failure, log upload, service cleanup (always runs), container verification

4. **Key Features**:
   - Uses multi-file service configuration (`todo-app/services/`)
   - Implements health check waiting with wait-for-services.sh script
   - Captures and uploads logs only on failure
   - Always runs cleanup step regardless of job outcome
   - Uploads test results as artifacts with 7-day retention
   - Comprehensive container status verification at each stage

5. **Security**:
   - GitHub token passed securely to build process only
   - No secrets persisted in final Docker images
   - Uses GitHub's automatic GITHUB_TOKEN secret

**Phase 1 - Helper Scripts (Already completed)**:
- wait-for-services.sh was already created and is ready to use

**Database Connectivity & Test Reporting Improvements (Completed 2025-10-12)**

**Problem**: E2E tests were failing in CI with 502 errors due to:
1. Services crashing immediately when database wasn't ready
2. No JUnit XML test reports being generated (tests exited before reporters could run)
3. Need for custom markdown test reports instead of external GitHub action

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Database Connection Retry Logic** (`todo-app/src/todo-services/shared/database.js`):
   - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff (max 30 retries, ~2.5 minutes)
   - Increased connection timeout from 2s to 5s
   - Clean up failed connection pools between retries
   - Services now gracefully wait for postgres instead of crashing

2. **Docker Compose Healthchecks** (`xq-compose.yml`):
   - Added postgres healthcheck using `pg_isready` command
   - Services use `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`
   - Fixed init.sql volume mount path for CI compatibility
   - Added healthchecks for read/write services and gateway
   - Proper service startup orchestration ensures database is ready before services connect

3. **JUnit XML Reporting** (`todo-app/e2e-tests/`):
   - Configured `jest-junit` reporter in jest.config.js
   - Fixed test-setup.js to throw errors instead of calling process.exit()
   - Changed `bail: false` to run all tests even if some fail
   - Added xml2js dependency for XML parsing
   - Reports now generated at `junit.xml` with full test details

4. **Custom Markdown Report Generator** (`todo-app/e2e-tests/utils/test-results-to-markdown.js`):
   - Rewrote utility to parse JUnit XML instead of JSON
   - Generates GitHub-flavored markdown with summary, suite breakdowns, and error details
   - Collapsible `<details>` sections for passed tests (keeps report compact)
   - Expanded failed test sections with stack traces
   - Integrated into GitHub Actions workflow via $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY

5. **Workflow Updates** (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`):
   - Removed external `mikepenz/action-junit-report` action
   - Added "Convert test results to markdown" step
   - Test results visible directly in GitHub Actions summary tab
   - Both XML and markdown uploaded as artifacts (7-day retention)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Services reliably start in CI environment with proper database wait handling
- ✅ Complete test reports generated even when tests fail
- ✅ Test results visible directly in GitHub UI without external dependencies
- ✅ Better debugging with collapsible sections and full error details
- ✅ No external GitHub action dependencies for reporting

**Recent Minor Updates (2025-10-20)**:
- Updated README.md version section from 0.0.2 to 0.1.0 with comprehensive feature list
- Updated TASKS.md progress tracking with current status
- File permission change on bin/xq-infra.js (made executable with chmod +x)

**Current State Summary**:
- E2E workflow fully functional and tested
- Database connection resilience implemented
- Test reporting with JUnit XML and custom markdown working
- CI and E2E workflows both have badges in README
- Documentation comprehensive and up-to-date
- Todo-app example fully demonstrates xq-infra capabilities

**Next Steps**:
- Phase 3 ready for CI workflow review (badges already present, may just need verification)
- Phase 4 ready for testing and validation (all prerequisites complete)
- Phase 5 ready for documentation and optimization work
- All core functionality complete and working
